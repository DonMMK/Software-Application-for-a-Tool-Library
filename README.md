# Software-Application-for-a-Tool-Library
Develop a software application to solve a real-world problem. To implement this software application, you will need to use some of the data structures and algorithms covered in this unit, to store, manage and manipulate data. It will be necessary to design algorithms, to solve the computational problems arising during the development process, and to analyse the time efficiency of the algorithms.
